# Smoother

This project was inspired by James Bruton's video on servo smoothing.
He uses a discrete low pass filter on the input signals to achieve the desired effect.
This library here provides the same functionality in a more concise and reusable way.

On top of that, it can easily be used as a low pass filter wherever one is needed.
